# Features
This clock face supports Blood Glucose (CGM - continuous glucose monitoring) data from XDrip+, Spike, or Nightscout. 

Includes: 

- Weather
- Heart-rate
- Steps
- Active minutes
- Battery charge level (as text (percentage) and as the size of the arc
- Graph of recent glucose readings
- Current BG reading
- Current delta
- Trend arrow
- Time since last pull from Xdrip (Xdrip only pushes data once every 5 mins)
- Insulin-on-board and Carbs-on-board
- Pop up full size BG graphs

-Note that when current BG reading is low, Current BG will turn red, arc will turn red, and graph point will turn red. 
-When current BG reading is high, Current BG will turn orange, arc will turn orange, and graph point will turn orange. 
-When there is a missed BG reading, Current BG will have a gray strike-through, arc will turn gray, and graph point will turn gray and be placed in the middle of the graph. 
-A current BG of question marks means a connection with your phone (companion) has not been established, try tapping on the screen to refetch the data from Xdrip.

You can also bring up a large graph AT ANY TIME by clicking on the screen (may take a second or two to come up due to fetching more BG data points).

BG readings are fetched around every 2 minutes. 

Units/thresholds are taken from source (e.g., from xdrip) or as inputted manually in the settings.

'Disable alert' should disable all alerts except very low.

There is now an option to only alert if the watch is detected as being worn. This will prevent the watch from losing all its batteries for an alert when it is not being worn and a person is not there to snooze the alarm.

On alerts, 'Mute' is for 4 HOURS, 'Snooze' is for as many minutes as set in the settings (default 15 minutes). 
Snooze and mute should ALSO snooze alert on xdrip/spike.

-An |S| indicates a snooze is ongoing; a |M| indicates a mute is ongoing; a |D| indicates that alerts have been disabled.

-In the settings you can select whether you would like the snooze and mute to clear when BG is back in range.

**DO NOT USE FOR ANY MEDICAL/TREATMENT PURPOSES!**

This is made and based on the awesome fitbit clockfaces published by **PedanticAvenger (FlashCGM)** and **Rytiggy (Glance)**. As an amateur coder, these repositories were immensly helpful.
